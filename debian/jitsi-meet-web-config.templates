_Description: SSL certificate for the Jitsi Meet instance
 .
 Jitsi Meet is best to be set up with an SSL certificate.
 .
 Having no certificate, a self-signed one will be generated.
 In the case of using a self-signed certificate, only the web app will be available with some warnings, the mobile app will not connect.
 Self-signed certificates are not supported by JaaS (Jitsi as a Service).
 .
 Having a certificate signed by a recognised CA, it can be uploaded on the server and point its location.
 The default filenames will be /etc/ssl/--domain.name--.key for the key and /etc/ssl/--domain.name--.crt for the certificate.
